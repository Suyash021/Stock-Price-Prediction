# Overview :

## In this Project, I have developed a Prediction model which used Yfinance Module to get the Stocks history of some desired company.

## For This Project i Have selected Data of the Company Nvidia from 1999 till 2024.

## I have used Jupyter notebook with Python -- version 3.12.0

## In Data_Collection.py I have imported the required Data in the csv file from the Yfinance Module. 

## For actual task of creating a PRediction Model I have Used LSTM Algorithm and also to Process the Data and visualization i have used libraries like Numpy , Matplotlib , Seaborne, Sci-kit learn ,Pandas and Keras tensorflow for Training the model.
